/// A custom shape that represents a star with a specified number of corners and smoothness factor.
///
/// The `Star` shape can be used to create star-like designs in SwiftUI by defining the number of corners and the smoothness of the star's inner points.
/// - Parameters:
///   - corners: The number of corners (or points) of the star. Must be 2 or greater to form a valid shape.
///   - smoothness: A value between 0 and 1 that determines how far the inner points of the star are from the center. Higher values create a more "smooth" or rounded star.
